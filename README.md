Just testing a server discord bot built with Deno and hosted on Deno
Deploy

## Final remakrs

Serverless is cool, works pretty neat if i only want slash commands.
The only issue being, almost everything is to be done manually over
the discord REST api, including interaction deferrings, editing
interaction responses, commands that do heavy works and take long
time. It's fine if the project is small or simple, but for anything
more, its much more better to use the bot gateway.
